# advice-generator
This is my solution for the advice generator app on frontendmentor.io. The template can be found here: https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/advice-generator-app-QdUG-13db.

It fetches a quote and an ID number from a third party API. It then displays that quote and the corresponding ID number on the page. You can click the teal dice button to reroll the advice fetch. It uses a useEffect hook in order to run the fetchRandomizeAdvice function upon initial rendering and the useState hook in order to handle the advice/ID number.
